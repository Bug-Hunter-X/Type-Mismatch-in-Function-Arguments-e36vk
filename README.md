# Type Mismatch in Function Arguments

This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript where a function receives arguments of a different type than what it expects.  The error and its solution are presented in separate `.ts` files.

**bug.ts** contains the code with the type error.  **bugSolution.ts** shows how to correct the error by ensuring the function receives the correct argument types.
